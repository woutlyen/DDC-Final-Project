# Final Project -  Digital Design Concepts

Welcome to my digital design project! 

## Features
This project, developed as part of the Digital Design Concepts course at KU Leuven, shows text in different colours on a VGA monitor using a Pynq-Z2 board running verilog code on its FPGA. What's neat is that we can also change the background colour to make things more interesting.

There is also a "RainbowMode" which displays the text in the colours of the rainbow. It uses a finite state machine to control all the transitions between the colours.

Finally, there is also a reset function which resets the whole system.
